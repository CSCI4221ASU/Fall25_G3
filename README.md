          About Me
          
              My name is Lauryn. My role in the group is Project Manager.
              I am responsible for coordinating tasks, keeping track of deadlines, and making sure the group stays on track. Our project is a universal scanner app designed to scan barcodes from major retail stores in Canada and the U.S. Once a barcode is scanned, the app displays detailed information about the item. This app improves efficiency by eliminating the need for customers to download multiple store-specific scanning apps.
